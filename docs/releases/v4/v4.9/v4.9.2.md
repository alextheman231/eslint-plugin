# v4.9.2 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- This is just a test release to test the new automatic `commit-version-change` workflow. Previously we had to workflow_dispatch, but I have refactored it so that it could potentially work with a push onto main.

## Additional Notes
