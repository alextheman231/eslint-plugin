# v4.8.6 (Patch release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Set the severity of `jsdoc/require-jsdoc` rule in `personal/utility` config (used in `@alextheman/utility`) to `"error"`
    - Since my utility package has now fully adopted JSDoc comments, this enforces documentation on all future functions, preventing missing documentation from slipping through.

## Additional Notes

- This change is only considered a patch release because it affects the `personal` ESLint config group, which is not recommended for public use outside of my own projects and should therefore not cause any major refactors to most other use cases.
- Future utility additions without JSDoc comments will now fail linting automatically, reinforcing documentation standards.
