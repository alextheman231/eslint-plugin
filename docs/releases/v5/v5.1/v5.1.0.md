# v5.1.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Pins `eslint-plugin-perfectionist` to >=5
    - This was meant to be done during the actual v5 release of this package, but I forgot. Hence I am following it up in this minor release while it's early.
    - This is being done because I am using new features of `eslint-plugin-perfectionist` in my personal configs, and so it is no longer compatible with v4.

## Additional Notes

- This change should hopefully not affect you if you don't have `eslint-plugin-perfectionist` installed in your repositories at less than v5. If you do, please consider updating that package anyway because a lot of the sorting rules there are far more flexible than they were in v4 and I think it's worth it.
- If you aren't ready to update that package, though, please pin this plugin to a version that is compatible with v4.
