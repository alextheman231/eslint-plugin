# v5.1.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a rule to `personal/javascript` to sort class properties.
    - My utility package now has three different utility classes, so I figured it'd be nice to enforce a consistent order of properties within them.
    - Of course, sorting is fixable, so my projects can easily migrate over my running the fixer.

## Additional Notes

- This is a rule added to a personal config, hence it is not expected to break any other projects besides my own. If it does, then that's not my problem because you shouldn't be relying on my personal configs in production code, unless you are me.
