## Description of Changes

- Disable `standardise-error-messages` in `internal/typescript`
    - That rule comes from a time long before I introduced `DataError` and made that the standard error across my repositories.
    - Now that I have that, which allows for a more descriptive error than the usual `Error` class, this is not needed anymore.
    - If I want to throw an error with a standard message, that is what the `DataError` code is for now. Error messages from the regular class can be the more descriptive human error message now.
    - The actual plugin rule itself is still being kept around for now, though, in case other users may still want to use it. I'm just disabling it for me personally as it no longer serves its purpose for my use cases.
