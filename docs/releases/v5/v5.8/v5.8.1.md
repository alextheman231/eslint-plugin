## Description of Changes

- Disable the `@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare` rule in `internal/typescript` config.
    - For the most part, it tends to warn more about false positives coming from my const object pattern than it does at actually spotting real issues.
    - That is:

    ```typescript
    const Entrypoint {
        ROOT: "@alextheman/eslint-plugin",
        UTILITY: "@alextheman/eslint-plugin/utility"
    } as const
    type Entrypoint = typeof Entrypoint[keyof typeof Entrypoint]
    ```

    tends to give a false positive despite it being common throughout my repositories.
    - I intend for the type name and const object name to match as it feels more consistent with actual enum behaviour but makes the separation of type and value clearer.
    - This is a personal rule disable for my own repositories. It should not affect anyone not using my internal configurations.
