# v5.5.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Adds `fixStyle: "separate-type-imports"` to the `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports` rule in the `general/typescript` configuration.
    - This ensures that when the auto-fixer runs to fix any type imports, it always keeps them separate. Previously it would've just inserted the `type` keyword but not always separate them out and I'd have to remember to do this myself.
    - I prefer keeping them separate to value imports as I find this to be clearer and it plays better with my sorting rules.
- Adds `no-duplicate-imports` to `general/javascript` and `general/typescript`.
    - `general/javascript` uses this to ensure that absolutely no import statements are duplicated. This then gets overriden in `general/typescript` to allow for the exception where we want to allow type imports to be separate from value imports.
