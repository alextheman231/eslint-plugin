**Status**: In progress

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It fixes issues with the package and should require no refactoring. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Add `import/consistent-type-specifier-style` rule to the `personal/javascript` config.
    - This ensures that all type imports must be top-level. A lot of other rules I have enabled only tend to **prefer** this when autofixing most of the time, but this one actually will fail linting if there is a type import that is not top-level, and **always** will autofix it to be top-level.
    - It just feels clearer to have that separation between type imports and value imports to me, rather than having them both in the same barrel.

## Additional Notes

- I know, I am picky.
- At least this time, the pickiness is being contained in my personal configs rather than the general ones!
- Not that it **would** cause that much refactoring if it were in a general config anyway - the fix is just to run the fixer, at the end of the day...
- But yeah, I am picky.
