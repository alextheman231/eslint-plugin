# v5.2.2 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Disables the `n/no-unpublished-import` in `general/javascript`
    - It was giving false positives when using `prisma` and `dotenv`, for some reason, even though they are probably fine to use considering I have literally installed them and used them.
