# v5.2.3 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Removes all imports from `src/index` in the plugin.
    - Probably not the best idea to import from the package's entrypoint within the package itself.
    - It kinda works, but it is a little risky considering that if the plugin is trying to import from the entrypoint, but a given file is also trying to export from the same entrypoint, you may end up with a partially resolved thing when you try using it.

## Additional Notes

- Probably should've done this sooner, but better late than never, I suppose.
