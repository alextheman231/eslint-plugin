# v5.4.2 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `@alextheman/eslint-plugin` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds outputOptions to internal tsdown config.
    - This is needed to get rid of a warning about named and default exports with tsdown.
    - It is not expected to affect anyone's use cases, but considering that the build process has changed, I decided to change the version here just in case it does have an effect on other projects using the plugin.
