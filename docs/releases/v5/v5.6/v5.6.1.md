## Description of Changes

- Install `@typescript-eslint/types` as a runtime dependency.
    - This should fix the error message we get when we try and use the configs without this installed.
    - Even though we do not use this ourselves, it does seem to be used by `eslint-plugin-perfectionist` internally, so its use of this causes our code to error for some reason.
    - It is weird, but I think this should fix it.
- Add `fixupPluginRules` to `typescript-eslint` plugin definition in `internal/utility`.
    - I forgot to add it there previously, but it is needed to ensure that `typescript-eslint` is compatible with ESLint v10.
